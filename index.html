                MIT’s finances come are a complex mix of industry and government funding. Some labs and projects rely extremely heavily on millions of dollars per year from government organizations like the NIH and NSF. Others support their research with huge donations from corporate sponsors. Some departments are magnets for outside funding, while others get almost nothing.

            Every year, MIT publishes its “Brown Book,” a summary of the contributions to and expenditures by the entire Institute. We focused on the on-campus research rather than MIT’s external labs, like Lincoln Lab.

            MIT spent nearly $210 million on research salaries in FY2014, part of a total research volume of $678 million. Industry grants made up just $9 million of this figure, but industry contracts to MIT in FY2014 total $104 million.

            The U.S. Department of Defense is a massive source of funding for MIT. It made up a combined $82.5 million of the government’s total $371 million in grants to MIT in FY2014. This is in addition to more than $40 million in contracts it awarded MIT that year.

            The US Navy is the fastest-growing source of grants and contracts out of all single government agencies. Since FY 2010, funding from the US Navy has gone up 32 percent unadjusted for inflation and 26 percent adjusted for inflation, up to a FY2014 total of just about $33 million.

            The MIT Energy Initiative, started in 2006, is the umbrella for energy research on campus. It relies extremely heavily on industry to fund its research, and it seems that the proportion of funds coming from industry is actually growing. Most of the contributors are major energy corporations.

            The School of Engineering had a research volume of nearly $269 million in FY2014, and the School of Science nearly $134 million. But the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the School of Architecture and Planning each received less than $1 million; Sloan’s research wing spent about $10 million on its research.
